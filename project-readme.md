# Coin Detection and Image Stitching

**IMT2022059 â€“ Pudi Kireeti**

## Overview

This project consists of two parts:

1. **Coin Detection, Segmentation, and Counting**
   - Detect coins using edge detection techniques
   - Segment individual coins using region-based segmentation
   - Count the total number of detected coins

2. **Image Stitching for Panorama Creation**
   - Detect key points in overlapping images
   - Use homography to align and stitch images into a panorama

## Part 1: Coin Detection, Segmentation, and Counting

This section detects, segments, and counts Indian coins in an image.

### Steps Involved:

- **Edge Detection (Contours Method):**
  - Convert the image to grayscale: `cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)` is used.
  - Apply Gaussian Blur and Canny edge detection: `cv2.GaussianBlur` and `cv2.Canny` are used.
  - Find contours to detect coin boundaries: `cv2.findContours` is used.
  - Outline detected coins in green: `cv2.drawContours` with green color (0, 255, 0) is used.

- **Segmentation:**
  - Filter valid coins based on area and circularity criteria: The `filter_valid_coins` function does this.
  - Create masks for each valid coin: `cv2.drawContours` with `thickness=cv2.FILLED` is used to create masks.
  - Extract individual coin segments using the masks: `cv2.bitwise_and` is used with the masks.

- **Counting Coins:**
  - The total number of detected coins is determined by counting valid contours: `len(valid_coins)` gives the count.
  - Display the final count in the terminal: `print(f"Final Coin Count: {len(valid_coins)}")` is used.

### Requirements

Install the required dependencies using:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

### How to Run

Place your input image in the `input_images/` folder and update the image path in `1.py`.
Then run:
```
python 1.py
```

### Methods Used:

- **Preprocessing:** Grayscale conversion and Gaussian blur to reduce noise
- **Edge Detection:** Canny edge detection with optimized thresholds for coin boundaries
- **Contour Detection:** Identifying closed shapes that represent coins
- **Filtering:** Using area and circularity metrics to eliminate non-coin objects
- **Segmentation:** Creating masks for each coin and extracting individual segments

### Implementation Comparisons

1. **Better Edge Preservation in Preprocessing**
   - **Good Code**: Uses a smaller Gaussian blur kernel (7,7) to reduce noise while keeping fine edges intact.
   - **Bad Code**: Uses a larger Gaussian blur kernel (11,11), which over-smooths the image, leading to weaker edges and possible loss of small or faint coin boundaries.

2. **Improved Edge Detection Parameters**
   - **Good Code**: Uses lower Canny thresholds (20, 150) to detect faint edges of coins.
   - **Bad Code**: Uses higher Canny thresholds (30, 150), which may cause some faint edges to be ignored, leading to missed coins.

3. **Better Morphological Operations for Contour Detection**
   - **Good Code**: Uses a smaller kernel (3x3) for `cv2.morphologyEx`, which preserves finer details and retains accurate coin boundaries.
   - **Bad Code**: Uses a larger kernel (5x5), which may merge close objects, leading to inaccurate contours.

4. **More Realistic Coin Filtering Criteria**
   - **Good Code**:
     - Area: 800 to 60,000
     - Circularity: > 0.6
   - **Bad Code**:
     - Area: 1,000 to 50,000
     - Circularity: > 0.7
   - The good code allows detection of slightly irregular or small coins, while the bad code is too strict and may filter out valid coins.

5. **Better Contour Retention**
   - **Good Code**: Uses lower area and circularity thresholds, helping detect both small and large coins.
   - **Bad Code**: Uses higher circularity (0.7), which may reject slightly oval coins.

6. **More Robust Display and Visualization**
   - **Good Code**:
     - Draws detected contours in green.
     - Uses 2x4 subplot arrangement to display segmented coins properly.
   - **Bad Code**:
     - Also uses 2x4 but doesn't optimize segmentation display as effectively.

7. **Better Documentation and Code Readability**
   - **Good Code**: Has clearer comments and docstrings explaining each function.
   - **Bad Code**: Has fewer explanations, making it harder to understand

## Part 2: Image Stitching

This section stitches overlapping images into a single panorama.

### Steps Involved:

- **Feature Detection & Matching:**
  - Uses SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) to extract keypoints: `cv2.SIFT_create()` and `sift.detectAndCompute()` are used.
  - Matches keypoints using FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors): `cv2.FlannBasedMatcher()` and `flann.knnMatch()` are used.
  - Filters matches based on a ratio test to keep only good matches: the code applies a ratio test (`m.distance < 0.7 * n.distance`).

- **Homography & Warping:**
  - Computes the homography matrix using RANSAC algorithm: `cv2.findHomography(..., cv2.RANSAC, ...)` is used.
  - Warps the left image to align with the right image: `cv2.warpPerspective()` is used.
  - Creates a seamless panorama by combining the warped images: the warped left image is combined with the right image.

### Requirements

Install dependencies using:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

### How to Run

Place overlapping images in the `input_images/` folder and update the image path in `2.py`.
Then run:
```
python 2.py
```

### Methods Used:

- **Feature Detection:** SIFT algorithm to find distinctive keypoints
- **Matching:** FLANN-based matcher with KD-tree for efficient matching: The FLANN matcher with `FLANN_INDEX_KDTREE` is used.
- **Filtering:** Ratio test to eliminate poor matches
- **Homography:** RANSAC method to find the optimal transformation matrix
- **Warping:** Perspective transformation to align and combine images

### Example Inputs & Outputs

**Original overlapping images:**
[IMAGE: Two overlapping input images]

**Keypoints:**
[IMAGE: Images with keypoints highlighted]

**Keypoints matching:**
[IMAGE: Visualization of matched keypoints between images]

**Final stitched image:**
[IMAGE: Final panorama]

**Failed results:**
[IMAGE: Examples of failed stitching]

### Implementation Comparisons

1. **Proper Keypoint Detection (SIFT)**
   - **Good Code**: Uses SIFT (`cv2.SIFT_create()`) to detect keypoints and compute descriptors in both images.
   - **Bad Code**: Uses the same SIFT detector but visualizes keypoints in pink instead of a standard color (blue/green), which is just a visual issue.
   - **Why it's good**:
     - SIFT is robust to scale and rotation changes.
     - Helps find distinct features for matching.

2. **Correct Keypoint Matching (FLANN with Ratio Test)**
   - **Good Code**:
     - Uses FLANN-based matching with correct settings (trees=5, checks=50).
     - Applies Lowe's Ratio Test (`m.distance < 0.7 * n.distance`) to filter only good matches.
   - **Bad Code**:
     - Uses FLANN but incorrectly sets trees=1 and checks=5, which weakens feature matching.
     - Keeps all matches, even bad ones, leading to incorrect alignments.
   - **Why it's good**:
     - The ratio test removes false matches by ensuring the best match is significantly better than the second-best match.
     - Using trees=5 and checks=50 improves match accuracy.

3. **Correct Homography Estimation**
   - **Good Code**:
     - Finds homography matrix (H) using `cv2.findHomography(src_pts, dst_pts, cv2.RANSAC, 5.0)`.
     - Uses RANSAC to eliminate outliers in feature matches.
   - **Bad Code**:
     - Uses a fixed transformation matrix (`H = [[1, 0, 100], [0, 1, 50], [0, 0, 1]]`), which is incorrect.
     - The fixed matrix does not align images properly.
   - **Why it's good**:
     - Homography matrix (H) correctly maps one image onto another.
     - RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) removes incorrect feature matches, improving accuracy.

4. **Proper Image Warping & Blending**
   - **Good Code**:
     - Uses `cv2.warpPerspective(left_img, H, (width * 2, height))` to warp the left image correctly.
     - Places the right image correctly without incorrect overlapping.
   - **Bad Code**:
     - Uses a fixed H, leading to misalignment and a badly overlapped panorama.
   - **Why it's good**:
     - Warping with a correct homography matrix ensures proper perspective alignment.
     - Overlapping region is preserved correctly, preventing distorted images.
